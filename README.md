# Miscellaneous Coding Fun
## Includes:

### form2doc.gs
Small google script that takes a form submission and saves the information in a google sheet. Built to streamline and organize documentation created during schooling. Teachers can fill out a google form, including meeting details, and the form then produces documentation containing a timestamp, in a folder specific to the student. Created for an anonymous Reddit user /u/Daydreamer8184 who works as a special educator. 

### CHANGEBASE.8xp
A small program made in TI-Basic, mostly for fun, that converts numbers between Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal. Works for positive numbers up to around 10^12 (the TI-Basic remainder() function breaks when higher) but that still means all 32 bit numbers work fine. Useful for some of the CompSci courses I've taken, and shared here for anyone to use.
** I programmed this by hand on the TI-84 Plus CE and only then realized you can download a program that lets you just type it up on your computer. Never again. **
